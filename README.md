## Description ## 
This script renames the files on current directory to a specific format of my choosing.
#### Example ####
"My_Dir/example.c" is renamed to "My_Dir/"[My_Dir]- example.c" 

This format has no particular benefit nor it is mandatory to use on files sent to professors. I just find it particularly useful when moving and printing files.
