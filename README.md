## Description ## 
This script adds the directory name to files within it as a prefix.
- Default format: `[$DIR_NAME]- $FILE_NAME` 
----
**Example**

My_Dir/example.c" is renamed to "My_Dir/"[My_Dir]- example.c"

-----
This format has no particular benefit nor it is mandatory to use on files sent to professors. I just find it particularly useful when moving and printing files.
